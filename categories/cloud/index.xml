&lt;p>This project focuses on analyzing the evolution of global Human Development Indices (HDI), Gender Development Index (GDI), and Gender Inequality Index (GII) over time (1990â€“2023), using cloud-based data pipelines and interactive visualizations. By investigating the influence of major global crises such as wars, pandemics, and political upheavals, this analysis highlights how significant socio-political events impact human development metrics. The project provides an insightful look at the intersection between global events and human development, offering an effective visualization of these trends to support better decision-making.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
