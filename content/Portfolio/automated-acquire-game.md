The Automated Acquire Game project is a Python-based implementation of the classic board game [Acquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire), designed to simulate and automate gameplay. It includes intelligent decision-making algorithms to simulate player behavior and strategic gameplay. The project is modular, handling different aspects of the game such as gameplay flow, board state, and AI-driven player logic.

## Key Features

- **Automated Gameplay**: AI-driven simulation allows the game to play itself with no human input.
- **Player Behavior Modeling**: Uses game-tree logic to simulate strategic decision-making.
- **Board Management**: Automates tile placement, hotel formation, mergers, and score calculation.
- **Game Tree Logic**: Evaluates possible moves and predicts outcomes for better strategy.

---

## Impact

This project adds an AI-powered dimension to a classic strategy board game, making it a strong showcase for algorithms, decision trees, and game theory. It offers a foundation for developing more complex game-playing AI or simulating various player types.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for game logic and AI.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used for modular, maintainable design.
- **Game Trees**: Models all possible actions and outcomes.
- **AI Algorithms**: Simulate strategic behavior and decision-making.
- **Pytest + JSON**: For high-coverage unit tests and scenario validation.
