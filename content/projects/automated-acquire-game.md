## Project Overview

The **Automated Acquire Game** project is a Python-based implementation of the classic board game *Acquire*, designed to simulate and automate gameplay. It includes intelligent decision-making algorithms to simulate player behavior and strategic gameplay. The project is divided into modules that handle different aspects of the game, including gameplay, board management, and player behavior.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Gameplay**: AI-driven simulation of gameplay, allowing the game to run autonomously without human input.
- **Player Behavior Modeling**: Simulates human-like decision-making using game tree analysis.
- **Board Management**: Automates the handling of tiles, hotel acquisitions, and game state.
- **Game Tree Logic**: Evaluates possible moves and predicts the outcome of each action taken during gameplay.

### Impact:
The project brings an AI-driven dimension to traditional board games, making it a great tool for showcasing AI, algorithms, and game theory. It allows users to explore how strategic decisions are made in a game setting, and could also be expanded with more complex AI for even deeper gameplay analysis.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core language used for implementing game logic and AI.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Design pattern employed to organize the game into logical modules.
- **Game Trees**: Used to model possible moves and strategies.
- **AI Algorithms**: For decision-making and player behavior simulation.


- This project is part of coursework and hosted in a private repository. Code available upon request.
