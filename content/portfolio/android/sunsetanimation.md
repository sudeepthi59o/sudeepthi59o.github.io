A simple Android app that simulates a sunset animation. Watch as the sun moves down the sky and the background color transitions from a blue sky to a beautiful sunset and eventually to a starry night.

### Core Features

- Smooth animation of the sun setting across the sky.
- Dynamic background color change from blue sky to sunset and night sky.
- Interactive: Tap anywhere on the screen to trigger the animation.

### Design

The app features a serene sky view, with a sun that moves down the screen to simulate the transition from day to night. The background color shifts from blue to sunset hues and then to a night sky, creating a peaceful, visually engaging experience.

### Challenges and Solutions

The primary challenge was syncing the sun's movement with the changing sky colors. Using an AnimatorSet, the sun's vertical movement was coordinated with the background color transitions to create a smooth, continuous animation.

### Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** for Android app development
- **Android Studio** as the IDE
- **ObjectAnimator**  for smooth animation transitions

### Demo

### Conclusion

This project allowed me to enhance my animation and UI development skills. Future improvements could include adding more dynamic elements, such as stars appearing in the night sky and adjusting the animation speed.
