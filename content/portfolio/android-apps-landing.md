## **Android Apps Collection**

### **1. [Calculator App](/portfolio/android/calculator/)**
A simple calculator that mimics the functionality and design of the iPhoneâ€™s default calculator. Supports basic arithmetic operations with a responsive UI.

A functional Android Notes App built with Firebase Authentication and Firestore. Features include secure user authentication, real-time syncing, and CRUD operations for note management.

### **3. [Ticketing Management App](/portfolio/android/ticketingapp/)**
A ticket management tool where users can create, update, and manage tickets with descriptions, images, and due dates.

### **4. [Sunset Animation App](/portfolio/android/sunsetanimation/)**
An interactive app where tapping the screen triggers an animation of the sun setting, transitioning from day to night.

### **6. [Posts App](/portfolio/android/postsapp/)**
