### Key Features:
- Manage products, including price, quantity, and category.
- Add and edit suppliers, including contact information.
- Easy-to-use web interface for seamless interaction with the database.
- Role-based authentication for secure access.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js (with hooks, context API) for a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java) for RESTful APIs and business logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable data storage.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on AWS for the server and RDS for database management.

### GitHub Actions (CI/CD):
This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The workflow includes:
- Running tests on every push and pull request.
- Building and packaging the Spring Boot application.

The `.github/workflows` directory contains the CI/CD configuration that ensures the project is always up to date and deployed after successful testing.

### Spring Libraries Used:
The Spring Boot backend leverages several powerful libraries and tools to provide a seamless experience for the application. Some key libraries include:
- **Spring Web**: For building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the PostgreSQL database using JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **Spring Security**: To handle user authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: For production-ready monitoring and management.
- **Spring Validation**: For validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and managing database entities.

### Purpose:
This project was built to showcase the capabilities of integrating modern web technologies for real-world applications. The goal is to provide a scalable, secure, and easy-to-use inventory management solution for small to medium-sized businesses.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Hibernate, Java
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
