## AWS Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance

### **Overview**
This project focuses on developing a Predictive Maintenance System using AWS and Machine Learning. The system predicts machine failures based on sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime. By leveraging AWS services, the project efficiently processes and analyzes data to provide real-time predictions of equipment malfunctions.

### **Technologies Used**
- **AWS Services:**
  - AWS SageMaker (for model training and deployment)
  - AWS S3 (for data storage)
  - AWS Lambda (for serverless computing)
  - AWS IAM (for access management)
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - (Explored CNNs and RNNs for future improvements)
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, AWS SDK (boto3)

### **Implementation**
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - Collected historical sensor data from machines stored in AWS S3.
   - Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) using AWS SageMaker.
   - Trained the models using large datasets stored in AWS S3.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. **Deployment & Real-Time Predictions:**
   - Deployed the trained models to AWS SageMaker for real-time predictions.
   - Integrated AWS Lambda to automatically trigger model predictions when new sensor data is available.
   
4. **Future Work & Enhancements:**
   - Explored the potential of deep learning models (CNN, RNN) for more accurate predictions.
   - Expanded the project to include automated maintenance decision-making based on model outputs.

### **Impact**
This system enables organizations to predict machine failures in advance, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. By deploying the model on AWS, the solution is scalable, cost-effective, and capable of handling large datasets.
